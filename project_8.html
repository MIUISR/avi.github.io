                            At the beginning of 2020 I started another project in my freetime. I wanted to create a
                            fullstack solution using some sort of machine learning algorithm.
                            My final idea intherited a web interface an user should be able to upload selfies with which
                            my algotihm predicts a dog breed most similar to the users facial features.
                            Short: A user should be able to find out which dog breed they are most similar to.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text">
                            Therefore I needed an architecture where a user can upload a picture through a web interace,
                            I can predict uploaded pictures in a back-end solution and visualize results through a web
                            interface back to the user.

                            Since I gained much experience with <code>Django</code> in my time at BMW, I wanted to build
                            my web interface with this framework in <code>Python</code>.
                            I wanted to build a up to date, simple and responsive website a user should intuitively be
                            able to use.

                            As you can see above, I designed this landing page quite minimalistic. A user should
                            instantly see what this website is about and what he needs to do.
                            To upload an picture I created a custom file form to read images and write them to the
                            back-end storage for thurder processing.

                            After choosing a file, the user just needs to press start to initialize processing handled
                            by back-end functionality.

                            After generating results, the user can see which dog breed he's most likely to by getting
                            the breeds name, prediction accuracy of this breed as well as an example picture.
                            If an user is not satisfied with its current results he can try to upload annother picture.

                            To predict dog breeds by images I built a Convolutional neural network trained on an own
                            generated dataset inheriting around 12.000 Bing-images of 65 different dog breeds.
                            Due to this high number of dog breeds and some random pictures in Bings search history
                            general performance is quite bad like expected (currently around 40% of test accuracy). I'm
                            using <code>Tensorflow 2 (Keras)</code> as machine learning library in <code>Python</code>.
                            I'm currently still working on the models architecture on Colab to try some new things I
                            didn't do before.

                            General back-end functionality to predict the current image is quite simple. Back-end
                            functionality will be triggered if an valid file (image) was uploaded through the file form.
