            <h1 class="project_header_1">head unit interface</h1>

            <p class="project_information">In this lecture our task was to build a user interface within a internet of things (IoT) use case.
                For that matter we had to build a interdisciplinary team consisting of at least one IoT-design student.
                However our IoT-design partner ended her education whereby we needed to design everything by ourselfs.</p>
            <p class="project_information">The idea we finally realized was a user interface by which a electric car driver can easily find a charging station.
                Our added value should be a search algorithm to find the best charging station suited for the current situation.
                Existing systems observe purely technical aspects needed for charging a car. Same applies for filters within the applicatons.
                We wanted to recognice the drivers and passengers needs by user inputs i.e. if a person needs to go to the toilet
                our systems pays attention and looks for a suitable charging station. For displaying this informations in a car we use
                car interfaces like Apple CarPlay or Android Auto.</p>
            <p class="project_information">At the top the user should be able to specify his situation by non technical situational requierements.
                This can be done by selecting a filter everyone should be able to personalize. Multiple filter can be selected to find
                the best charging station. At the bottom suitable charging stations are listed to get informations about them. At first
                only technical information will be shown. For further information the user needs to click on a charging station to
                get all details.</p>

            <p class="project_information" style="margin-top: 11.25vw">At this view every detail is shown to the user this means technical parameters and situation dependent requierements
                depending on the selected filters.</p>
