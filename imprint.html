                        pursuant to &sect; 7 para.1 TMG. According to &sect;&sect; 8 to 10 TMG, however, we as a service provider are
                        not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to search for circumstances that
                        indicate illegal activity.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text"> Obligations to remove or block the use of information according to the general laws remain unaffected. A
                        liability in this respect is only possible from the time of knowledge of a concrete violation of the law. As
                        soon as we become aware of such legal infringements, we will remove these contents immediately.

                    <h4>Liability for links</h4>
                    <p class="text">Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties over whose contents we have no influence.
                        Therefore, we cannot accept any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of
                        the pages is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible
                        legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognisable at the time of linking.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">A permanent control of the contents of the linked pages is, however, not reasonable without concrete evidence of
                        an infringement. If we become aware of any legal infringements, we will remove such links immediately.
