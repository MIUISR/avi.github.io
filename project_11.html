                        <p class="text">In order to deepen my knowledge of the current master lectures Data Analytics
                            and Predictive Analytics, I was looking for a project in my spare time, which is suitable
                            for statistical analysis. Last year I was busy writing a script that automatically
                            processes, visualizes and sends me the performance of stocks after the close of the trading
                            day via e-mail. In order to have more indicators to evaluate stocks, I decided to get into
                            the technical analysis of stocks. My goal was to determine further indicators that could be
                            used for a data-based valuation of stocks and their prices. Also to get an overview
                            of the performance of a stock based on last week's values, which I can interpret over the
                            weekend. In the following I wanted to
                            describe the first results of my analysis, which I want to expand on in the coming weeks.
                        </p>
                        <h2 style="padding-top: 2.5vh;"><span style="color: #DCDCDC;">#</span> Technical details</h2>
                        <p class="text">I basically use the same technologies as when I last dealt with the topic. As
                            programming language I use Python. As API for stock price queries I use Alpha Vantage. This
                            allows five free requests per minute, which is enough for a first test of my application.
                            Pandas offers a suitable data analytics framework for processing large tabular data sets.
                            Scipy also offered itself for the processing of data.</p>
                        <h2 style="padding-top: 2.5vh;"><span style="color: #DCDCDC;">#</span> Current results</h2>
                        <img src="./imgs/project_11/uber_example.png" alt="Uber technical analysis" data-aos="fade-up">
                        <p class="text">To visualize the stock data I created a box plot, where positive trends (close
                            larger than open) are displayed in green and negative trends (close smaller than open) in
                            red. For this I use Matplotlib. The volume of transactions is also shown in a subplot below.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text">To illustrate trends I calculated and visualized trend lines, which show the
                            trends of the high and low values and the mean value of the close prices. With the help of
                            linear regression I have created an intercept and slope of the respective functions and
                            determined all data points of the time values. High and low trends are also shifted by its
                            standard deviation in the respective direction.</p>
                        <p class="text">Two moving averages were calculated and visualized to determine golden cross,
                            death cross and crossover indicators. One is the Simple Moving Average (SMA) based on a time
                            window of 15 days, the other an Expontential Moving Average (EMA) based on a 100 day time
                            window.</p>
                        <p class="text">Based on an SMA consisting of a 20-day time window, a Bollinger Band was
                            calculated and displayed, which represents likely limits of price trends.</p>
                        <p class="text">Common Fibonacci Retracement levels were also calculated to represent certain
                            limits for support and resistance. For this purpose, the global maximum and minimum of the
                            current time window were identified, the difference between them was multiplied by ratios of
                            23.6%, 38.2%, 61.8% and subtracted from the maximum.</p>
                        <h2 style="padding-top: 2.5vh;"><span style="color: #DCDCDC;">#</span> Outlook</h2>
                        <p class="text">In the next few weeks I would like to delve further into the topic of technical
                            analysis in order to be able to calculate and present further indicators. As far as the
                            visualization of performance is concerned, I am currently satisfied. My focus will now be
                            more on interpreting all visualized data using calculated indicators. I would also like to
                            perform a prediction of the data using RNN/LSTM algorithms.</p>
